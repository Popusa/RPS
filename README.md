Hello! This is a simple RPS game I am making using Javascript! 

This is a basic project done with a GUI hooked up to event listeners.

It was a bit out of my comfort zone and I struggled a bit but that only made me learn more and love programming more.

Can't wait to keep learning more from The Odin Project!
